If you are hoping to buy an RTX card for the raytracing features then a 2070/2080/2080TI would be more suitable.You may have to lower a few settings on very recent games to maintain high framerates on 144hz 1440p monitors, however considering the price of this card is significantly lower compared to the more powerful RTX cards, the trade-off is well worth it if you are on a budget or want the best value for money.The card sits at around 50 degrees idle and reaches 80 degrees under load in my machine. Fans can get a little noisy at high speeds but the noise is not unbearable by any means. The card takes up 2 expansion slots on my case and has 3x DP1.2 outputs and 1 x HDMI output. The card needs an 8-pin pci-e connector for power. Installation was simple, the card doesn't sag and fits in my case with room to spare (NZXT H500)Overall if you are looking to upgrade from a previous generation card but don't want to break the bank then this is an excellent card for 1080P and 1440P gaming.\",\n",

With the current shortage situation that's been going on for awhile now, I knew I was in for a difficult time finding a fair price and and compatible GPU anywhere.That was until I found Topdealzmart here on Amazon.  The card I ordered was the MSI RTX 2060 VENTUS 6 GB OC Edition.  I do alot of editing and work with some animation, so with my needs, this was the best available GPU.  With the best price anywhere on the net.  I searched thoroughly.I found out that the card wouldn't be available latest July 8th.  Like I mentioned earlier, I needed it ASAP.  I contacted Topdealzmart and spoke with Sam.  Was seeing if there was anyway to get it sooner than the expected date.  Within minutes they responded, and without hesitation offered to overnight it next business day at no cost to me.  I wouldn't expect every order, especially a GPU to have the same option for everyone due to cost.  However, any company that is willing to get a product to you at the best price, and accommodate a request for a product in a time of shortage, deserves everyone's business.  Delivered in a week vs 3.  Whenever I need a PC part or any of their type of products I will gladly use them and recommend them to all my PC geek friends and family.Thanks so much Topdealzmart!

The card I ordered was the MSI RTX 2060 VENTUS 6 GB OC Edition.  I do alot of editing and work with some animation, so with my needs, this was the best available GPU.  With the best price anywhere on the net.  I searched thoroughly.I found out that the card wouldn't be available latest July 8th.  Like I mentioned earlier, I needed it ASAP.  I contacted Topdealzmart and spoke with Sam.  Was seeing if there was anyway to get it sooner than the expected date.  Within minutes they responded, and without hesitation offered to overnight it next business day at no cost to me.  I wouldn't expect every order, especially a GPU to have the same option for everyone due to cost.  However, any company that is willing to get a product to you at the best price, and accommodate a request for a product in a time of shortage, deserves everyone's business.  Delivered in a week vs 3.  Whenever I need a PC part or any of their type of products I will gladly use them and recommend them to all my PC geek friends and family.Thanks so much Topdealzmart!

If you are hoping to buy an RTX card for the raytracing features then a 2070/2080/2080TI would be more suitable.You may have to lower a few settings on very recent games to maintain high framerates on 144hz 1440p monitors, however considering the price of this card is significantly lower compared to the more powerful RTX cards, the trade-off is well worth it if you are on a budget or want the best value for money.The card sits at around 50 degrees idle and reaches 80 degrees under load in my machine. Fans can get a little noisy at high speeds but the noise is not unbearable by any means. The card takes up 2 expansion slots on my case and has 3x DP1.2 outputs and 1 x HDMI output.

Installation was simple, the card doesn't sag and fits in my case with room to spare (NZXT H500)Overall if you are looking to upgrade from a previous generation card but don't want to break the bank then this is an excellent card for 1080P and 1440P gaming.\",\n",

With a little undervolting and by adjusting the fans curve well you can have excellent results, stable boost frequency on 1900mHzat about -100mv.Without undervolt the card becomes no more noisy.The only scenario in which a little boost frequency is lost is when you use titles with raytracing.The plastic above the fans stretch after the end of the PCB to join the equally long backplate.There is nothing in those 2cm.If I wanted to disassemble the backplate and the other piece (Deshroud) I would also be forced to remove the heatsink (then having to wander the sparrowers for the screws that mount the Heatsink).A real shame because a 20cm card could be made in tiny houses.I wonder if engineers and designers work together.

If you are hoping to buy an RTX card for the raytracing features then a 2070/2080/2080TI would be more suitable.You may have to lower a few settings on very recent games to maintain high framerates on 144hz 1440p monitors, however considering the price of this card is significantly lower compared to the more powerful RTX cards, the trade-off is well worth it if you are on a budget or want the best value for money.The card sits at around 50 degrees idle and reaches 80 degrees under load in my machine. Fans can get a little noisy at high speeds but the noise is not unbearable by any means. The card takes up 2 expansion slots on my case and has 3x DP1.2 outputs and 1 x HDMI output. The card needs an 8-pin pci-e connector for power. Installation was simple, the card doesn't sag and fits in my case with room to spare (NZXT H500)Overall if you are looking to upgrade from a previous generation card but don't want to break the bank then this is an excellent card for 1080P and 1440P gaming.\",\n",

If you are hoping to buy an RTX card for the raytracing features then a 2070/2080/2080TI would be more suitable.You may have to lower a few settings on very recent games to maintain high framerates on 144hz 1440p monitors, however considering the price of this card is significantly lower compared to the more powerful RTX cards, the trade-off is well worth it if you are on a budget or want the best value for money.The card sits at around 50 degrees idle and reaches 80 degrees under load in my machine. Fans can get a little noisy at high speeds but the noise is not unbearable by any means. The card takes up 2 expansion slots on my case and has 3x DP1.2 outputs and 1 x HDMI output. The card needs an 8-pin pci-e connector for power. Installation was simple, the card doesn't sag and fits in my case with room to spare (NZXT H500)Overall if you are looking to upgrade from a previous generation card but don't want to break the bank then this is an excellent card for 1080P and 1440P gaming.\",\n",

       " \"I upgraded to this card from a GTX 970 which was struggling to run games at 1440p resolution.So far I haven't had any issues with the card. It can run pretty much anythingI throw at it at very respectable framerates (100+ on games like MORDHAU, R6 Siege and BFV on high/very high settings at 1440p), however this card does not cope well with raytracing, which absolutely tanks framerates when it is enabled. If you are hoping to buy an RTX card for the raytracing features then a 2070/2080/2080TI would be more suitable.You may have to lower a few settings on very recent games to maintain high framerates on 144hz 1440p monitors, however considering the price of this card is significantly lower compared to the more powerful RTX cards, the trade-off is well worth it if you are on a budget or want the best value for money.The card sits at around 50 degrees idle and reaches 80 degrees under load in my machine. Fans can get a little noisy at high speeds but the noise is not unbearable by any means. The card takes up 2 expansion slots on my case and has 3x DP1.2 outputs and 1 x HDMI output. The card needs an 8-pin pci-e connector for power. Installation was simple, the card doesn't sag and fits in my case with room to spare (NZXT H500)Overall if you are looking to upgrade from a previous generation card but don't want to break the bank then this is an excellent card for 1080P and 1440P gaming.\",\n",

With a little undervolting and by adjusting the fans curve well you can have excellent results, stable boost frequency on 1900mHzat about -100mv.Without undervolt the card becomes no more noisy.The only scenario in which a little boost frequency is lost is when you use titles with raytracing.The plastic above the fans stretch after the end of the PCB to join the equally long backplate.There is nothing in those 2cm.If I wanted to disassemble the backplate and the other piece (Deshroud) I would also be forced to remove the heatsink (then having to wander the sparrowers for the screws that mount the Heatsink).A real shame because a 20cm card could be made in tiny houses.I wonder if engineers and designers work together.

With the current shortage situation that's been going on for awhile now, I knew I was in for a difficult time finding a fair price and and compatible GPU anywhere.That was until I found Topdealzmart here on Amazon.  The card I ordered was the MSI RTX 2060 VENTUS 6 GB OC Edition.  I do alot of editing and work with some animation, so with my needs, this was the best available GPU.  With the best price anywhere on the net.  I searched thoroughly.I found out that the card wouldn't be available latest July 8th.  Like I mentioned earlier, I needed it ASAP.  I contacted Topdealzmart and spoke with Sam.  Was seeing if there was anyway to get it sooner than the expected date.  Within minutes they responded, and without hesitation offered to overnight it next business day at no cost to me.  I wouldn't expect every order, especially a GPU to have the same option for everyone due to cost.  However, any company that is willing to get a product to you at the best price, and accommodate a request for a product in a time of shortage, deserves everyone's business.  Delivered in a week vs 3.  Whenever I need a PC part or any of their type of products I will gladly use them and recommend them to all my PC geek friends and family.Thanks so much Topdealzmart!  The card is working great as well!  Best customer service I've ever came accross from a company on Amazon!\",\n",
       " \"Essentially This was my first pc i've ever built, and i put it together myself, with a little help from youtube. I will say so far it runs games such as fortnite, minecraft (with shaders), GTA 5, And loads of games at very bare bare minimum 60fps and runs at max somewhere in the hundreds, like right now fortnite with highish settings is running a solid 120 frames, and runs 240 frames with lower graphic settings. Honestly, Installing it was a little scary, since im inexperienced, but it was quickly really easy. Its also vr ready, and im able to use full body tracking very well, one gripe is that my monitor cant be used while I'm in vr and there will be certain issues I'll have with that, but that's not the cards fault itself just my setup. To anyone who is like me barely starting up in gaming or getting more serious instead of getting prebuilt this is definitely a card worth getting. Its also streaming and recording ready. For what its worth and the graphics card shortages that have been going on, this card is amazing!\",\n",

I contacted Topdealzmart and spoke with Sam.  Was seeing if there was anyway to get it sooner than the expected date.  Within minutes they responded, and without hesitation offered to overnight it next business day at no cost to me.  I wouldn't expect every order, especially a GPU to have the same option for everyone due to cost.  However, any company that is willing to get a product to you at the best price, and accommodate a request for a product in a time of shortage, deserves everyone's business.  Delivered in a week vs 3.  Whenever I need a PC part or any of their type of products I will gladly use them and recommend them to all my PC geek friends and family.Thanks so much Topdealzmart!

The card I ordered was the MSI RTX 2060 VENTUS 6 GB OC Edition.  I do alot of editing and work with some animation, so with my needs, this was the best available GPU.  With the best price anywhere on the net.  I searched thoroughly.I found out that the card wouldn't be available latest July 8th.  Like I mentioned earlier, I needed it ASAP.  I contacted Topdealzmart and spoke with Sam.  Was seeing if there was anyway to get it sooner than the expected date.  Within minutes they responded, and without hesitation offered to overnight it next business day at no cost to me.  I wouldn't expect every order, especially a GPU to have the same option for everyone due to cost.  However, any company that is willing to get a product to you at the best price, and accommodate a request for a product in a time of shortage, deserves everyone's business.  Delivered in a week vs 3.  Whenever I need a PC part or any of their type of products I will gladly use them and recommend them to all my PC geek friends and family.Thanks so much Topdealzmart!

I contacted Topdealzmart and spoke with Sam.  Was seeing if there was anyway to get it sooner than the expected date.  Within minutes they responded, and without hesitation offered to overnight it next business day at no cost to me.  I wouldn't expect every order, especially a GPU to have the same option for everyone due to cost.  However, any company that is willing to get a product to you at the best price, and accommodate a request for a product in a time of shortage, deserves everyone's business.  Delivered in a week vs 3.  Whenever I need a PC part or any of their type of products I will gladly use them and recommend them to all my PC geek friends and family.Thanks so much Topdealzmart!

With the current shortage situation that's been going on for awhile now, I knew I was in for a difficult time finding a fair price and and compatible GPU anywhere.That was until I found Topdealzmart here on Amazon.  The card I ordered was the MSI RTX 2060 VENTUS 6 GB OC Edition.  I do alot of editing and work with some animation, so with my needs, this was the best available GPU.  With the best price anywhere on the net.  I searched thoroughly.I found out that the card wouldn't be available latest July 8th.  Like I mentioned earlier, I needed it ASAP.  I contacted Topdealzmart and spoke with Sam.  Was seeing if there was anyway to get it sooner than the expected date.  Within minutes they responded, and without hesitation offered to overnight it next business day at no cost to me.  I wouldn't expect every order, especially a GPU to have the same option for everyone due to cost.  However, any company that is willing to get a product to you at the best price, and accommodate a request for a product in a time of shortage, deserves everyone's business.  Delivered in a week vs 3.  Whenever I need a PC part or any of their type of products I will gladly use them and recommend them to all my PC geek friends and family.Thanks so much Topdealzmart!  The card is working great as well!  Best customer service I've ever came accross from a company on Amazon!\",\n",
       " \"Essentially This was my first pc i've ever built, and i put it together myself, with a little help from youtube. I will say so far it runs games such as fortnite, minecraft (with shaders), GTA 5, And loads of games at very bare bare minimum 60fps and runs at max somewhere in the hundreds, like right now fortnite with highish settings is running a solid 120 frames, and runs 240 frames with lower graphic settings. Honestly, Installing it was a little scary, since im inexperienced, but it was quickly really easy. Its also vr ready, and im able to use full body tracking very well, one gripe is that my monitor cant be used while I'm in vr and there will be certain issues I'll have with that, but that's not the cards fault itself just my setup. To anyone who is like me barely starting up in gaming or getting more serious instead of getting prebuilt this is definitely a card worth getting. Its also streaming and recording ready. For what its worth and the graphics card shortages that have been going on, this card is amazing!\",\n",

Make Sure you write down the number and code on the card, they will ask for it when you try to register your card with MSI.  also, the card height - ADD another inch cause your wires plug into the top of the card - and is NOT Flush.  i didn't have a clearance problem with this, but you might.Rfactor does not use race tracing at this time, but if they ever do i will be ready.  card fans are not noisy.  if you have an old card like i did and you are sitting on the fence - go for it!\",\n",
