       "['Edit: Customer Service swapped my flawed GPU with a new in box video card.It works well, 85fps in Cinebench. But it does have two issues, and they are tenable. The four rear outputs are mislabeled. I have a programs that looks for device default audio on \"Playback Device Digital Audio 1\". I had to put the cable in port 3 to make it do that in the sound properties.The fan on the GPU is erratic. I used Speedfan to work around. On the \"Fan Control Tab\" I made a \"Fan Controller\" and used GPU Fan from ATI Video Card as the \"Controlled Speed\". With my 50MM helper fan controlled by the CPU Temp, the temps stay between 26C and 53C.About one year ago I bought my first USED peripheral from Amazon, a MSi RX560 4GB that still works great. So when I discovered that the New VisionTek RX560 4GB LP I ordered was fulfilled with an open box instead. I didn\\'t panic, because I always have a great experience with Amazon.How an open box got in with the New products, I will never know. The Amazon CS seemed surprised also, that I got an open box. But, she was very kind and ordered a replacement. So I predict happy days ahead.I did extensive trouble shooting prior to contacting Customer Support. And, after trying this GPU in 3 computers (W10 64 and W7 64), I am of the opinion, that this is a lightning strike or OC damaged GPU that was returned to Amazon. I would think it should have been RMA to VisionTek, for repairs.Since my PC had a working Radeon, a R7240 using V19.12.2 Adrenaline driver. I device manager uninstalled GPU driver, installed VGA and shut down. When RX560 card was installed, it booted, found it\\'s driver in the Adrenaline package and rebooted, but halted after the W7 \"Starting Windows\" swoosh disappeared.
