Some functions on it are hard to find.  I might have given this 5 stars except for one thing.  It doesn't come with a charging block.  I've never bought a phone that didn't come with one.  You pay a lot more for this phone than I saw on other sites, but that's probably because it's unlocked, but still.....to not include something so basic is highly disappointing.  I had to borrow a cord from someone else until I get the one I had to order.  Thank the Lord she had one.  Otherwise I wouldn't have been able to use it.  The second thing is that all the comments about long battery life are false.  Runs out about the same as my old phone.\",\n",

I've had the phone a few weeks now and it hasn't let me down yet. Very fast and very responsive given that the specs on this phone are considered the low of the low from Samsung.If you use your phone mainly for calls, texts, Facebook type apps, some web browsing, etc., you will be satisfied. I've even installed some games like Candy Crush and they work flawlessly.Battery life is outstanding. I went 2 full days using this phone like crazy, screen cranked up to the brightest setting and it was still at 54% power.The screen resolution looks fine to me. Honestly, unless you're sitting it next to some super high end phone, you will never see anything subpar about it.I highly recommend this phone to those who want to save some money and still have something decent.Again, realize this is a budget phone and don't expect something you'd get in the $1000 range.  Samsung does it again with another nice quality phone.The only cons would be, one - the camera quality is on the lower end.  I'm not a big picture taker so that isn't an issue for me. The second, Samsung doesn't give you a charger.I'd still give this phone a 5/5 in the budget category.Do your homework and know what you're getting.\",\n",

       " \"As stated, dual SIM was a lie. I got this phone - specifically this one - entirely because I was living in Japan, I needed a temporary phone just to last me until I got back to the US, and I was receiving calls and texts to both my US phone number and my JP phone number. It couldn't keep up with half my typing speed so any and all typing was laborious and painful, the camera was grainy trash that ruined a lot of the pictures I got (which really sucks since I was in Japan and I don't travel), and it got me lost multiple times because it couldn't figure out where I was or what direction I was facing in Google Maps. Not to mention the finger print scanner being on the side of the phone and trying to scan any time any part of me or sometimes metal touched it, leading to me often being locked out and having to slowly input my pin. Even search functionality was horribly slow. If nothing else was running, it still took several seconds to load up the search engine and keyboard and allow me to start typing. I knew this would be the worst smart phone I'd ever owned, but the dual SIM was supposed to make it worth it. If I'd known it wouldn't even detect its second SIM slot, I would've gotten a better phone for cheaper.TL;DR: Non-functioning second SIM slot, garbage in every other category including typing. Do not buy.\",\n",

       " 'Its screenshot feature is challenging to capture since it turns off if you are not pushing the two buttons perfectly.  The screen color looks fading (like pastel color) than actual color seen in eyes, or iPhone camera. It has dual SIM trays, but it only allows you use one SIM instead of two, so what is the point of having it dual SIM tray since the phone is not capable? Also, some of the feature is not user friendly.  The alarm which comes with this phone does not turn off immediately after pressing X button to shut it off.',\n",
       " 'My god trying to do anything on this phone is beyond frustrating, apps take up to 30 seconds between me tapping it and the app opening. Everything is so slow and the fingerprint scanner is completely non-functional. That plus this phone having absolutely no splash or water proofing makes it a complete waste. I recently had to call 911 for an ambulance and this phone let me down at every turn. Better off running and asking strangers to use theirs',\n",
       " \"I was so excited to get this phone based on the reviews and my own research. I've waited about half a year now and even my cell phone company is telling me to get rid of this phone. Calls drop and often I can't make calls because I am out of range, whatever that means - never happened with cheaper phones! The only way out of that is to turn it off and on again. I've had to contact my cell phone company three times now to reset the phone, which involves me removing the sim card, and turning it off while they do that from their end. When I asked how to avoid doing this, they said buy a new phone. How disappointing!!! I would not recommend this phone for that reason, for not making calls (see above), for not being loud enough for voicemails, for saying that my contacts to call do not exist when they do, for calls not going through -they dial and hang up. It's SO frustrating. I didn't get insurance, so, I am screwed and need to keep the phone, but it's sooo frustrating! Would not recommend.\",\n",

So I picked up this phone because it was cheep, worked on all the networks, and I could pass it on to my son when I was done with it. I figured it would work as a replacement for an almost three years old phone.....Well, I'm not impressed. The phone is sluggish at everything. From browsing the web to launching apps to taking photos....And the Samsung Android interface is sub-par compared to the Pixel.\",\n",

I was not charged a restocking fee for those items.

It will never charge that way.You have to have the plug to charge the phone. And, it doesn't come with a plug.They've dispensed with the back button in some interfaces and that's torture.The swipe gesture they've left you with (to go back) works once in fifty tries.The home button (Who uses the home button, on an Android?) is needed to take screenshots. ???\",\n",

       " \"I ordered this phone through Google Fi. The instructions say it should be fully charged before activating--except that it doesn't come with a charger. It only comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable. Good luck finding a device in your house that has a USB-C port. My USB hub doesn't. My desktop doesn't. My Dell laptop doesn't.Samsung's website description for the phone does not indicate it does not come with a charger and does not state what charger should be purchased for the phone. A review on Android Advisor says it's a 15W phone. Samsung's web store doesn't sell a 15W charger. Reviews on Android Advisor for chargers have a lot of negative comments on having to replace the charger. Amazon sells one, but has no reviews for that version.I've wasted a night trying to figure out how to activate this phone and find a charger. I finally decided to factory restore the phone and return it and get a Motorola phone that includes a charger. Samsung claims they aren't including a charger for environmental reasons. If I had an old phone with that charger, I wouldn't throw it away. It's a spare charger that can go in another room, the laptop bag, or put in a drawer in case the new one gets misplaced or damaged.Lesson learned. Verify that a new phone comes with a charger before buying. Otherwise, don't buy it.\"]"
